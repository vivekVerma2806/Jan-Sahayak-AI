# Jan Sahayak AI

A smart chatbot that helps you understand Indian government schemes. Upload scheme PDFs, ask questions in plain language, and get accurate answers backed by real document sources.

Built with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — every answer comes from the actual documents, not from AI guessing.

## What It Does

- Upload government scheme PDFs and index them automatically
- Ask questions in natural language about any scheme
- Get answers grounded strictly in the uploaded documents
- See exactly which document and page the answer came from
- Pre-loaded with 3 demo schemes to try instantly

## Demo Schemes Included

| Scheme | What It Covers |
|--------|---------------|
| Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana | Zero-balance bank accounts, RuPay cards, insurance |
| PM Kisan Samman Nidhi | Direct income support of ₹6,000/year for farmers |
| Ayushman Bharat (PM-JAY) | ₹5 Lakh cashless health coverage for families |

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom dark theme
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Embeddings**: Gemini Embedding 001
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **PDF Parsing**: PyPDF

## How It Works

```
PDF Upload → Text Extraction → Chunking (1000 chars) → Embedding → ChromaDB Storage
                                                                          ↓
User Question → Semantic Search → Top-K Retrieval → Gemini Generates Answer
```

1. PDFs are split into overlapping chunks of 1000 characters
2. Each chunk is converted into a 768-dimensional vector using Gemini embeddings
3. Vectors are stored in ChromaDB for fast similarity search
4. When you ask a question, it finds the most relevant chunks
5. Gemini reads those chunks and writes a grounded answer
